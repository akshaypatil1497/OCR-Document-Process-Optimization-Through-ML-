I am using Marmot Dataset for developing the model.
Training dataset link: https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/docs/20190424190300041510.zip

Making using of VGG19 (stands for Visual Geometry Group) encoder which 19 convolutional layers.

the model is referred from: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/table-extraction-using-deep-learning-3c91790aa200
